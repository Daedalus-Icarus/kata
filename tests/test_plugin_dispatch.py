"""Tests: resolving the subnet plugin for a submission/lane, with no subnet installed.

kata itself declares no subnet -- each real subnet lives in its own repo and is discovered via a
``kata.subnets`` entry point. These check the negative paths that hold regardless of what is
installed; discovery-with-a-real-subnet is tested in the subnet repos (e.g. kata-sn22).
